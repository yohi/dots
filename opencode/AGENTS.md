# Development Guidelines
- **Language Policy**: ALWAYS respond in Japanese. Think in English for technical precision, but ALL outputs (responses, documentation, comments, commit messages) MUST be in Japanese unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in Japanese.
- Code comments SHOULD be in Japanese for better readability.
- Git commit messages SHOULD be in Japanese.
