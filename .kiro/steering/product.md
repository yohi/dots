# Product Context

## Vision
A comprehensive, automated, and localized development environment setup for Ubuntu.
It aims to transform a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully production-ready workspace with a single command.

## Core Value Proposition
- **One-Liner Setup**: `curl | bash` simplicity for complete bootstrapping.
- **Japanese First**: Fully configured Japanese input (Mozc), fonts, and locale settings out of the box.
- **Modern Toolchain**: Pre-configured Neovim, Zsh, Docker, and AI-enabled editors (Cursor, VS Code).
- **Modularity**: Users can install specific components (e.g., just Vim or just GNOME settings) or the full suite.

## Key Capabilities
- **System Optimization**: Memory monitoring and performance tuning scripts.
- **GUI Automation**: GNOME extensions, keybindings, and tweaks applied automatically.
- **Dev-Ready**: Runtimes for Python, Node, Go, Rust, etc., pre-installed via Homebrew/ASDF.
- **Accessibility**: Fixes common issues like "Sticky Keys" automatically.
